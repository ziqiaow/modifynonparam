\title{Semiparametric Gene-Environment Interactions in Case-Control Studies}
\description{
An R package for analysis of gene-environment interactions in case-control studies,
using distribution-free retrospective methodology.  The method of Stalder et. al. (2017)
and the improvement suggested by Wang et. al (2018) use a retrospective likelihood
framework under the assumption of gene-environment independence (in the population)
to gain efficiency when estimating the interaction effects of genetic and environmental
variables.
}
\details{
Both methods treat the genetic and environmental variables nonparametrically,
facilitating the analysis of polygenic risk factors for which distributional assumptions
are difficult to justify.

\describe{
  \item{\code{\link{spmle}}}{implements method of Stalder et. al. (2017).  Given
    binary response \code{D} (disease status), a vector or matrix of genetic
    risk factors \code{G}, a vector or matrix of environmental risks \code{E},
    and the population disease rate \code{pi1}, \code{spmle} fits a model of the
    form \code{D ~ G * E} by maximizing the retrospective pseudolikelihood.}
  \item{\code{\link{spmleCombo}}}{implements the method of of Wang et. al (2018)
    under the same set of assumptions as \code{spmle}.  This function takes the
    same imput as \code{spmle} with the addition of \code{nboot} (number of
    bootstrap samples) and \code{ncores} (number of CPU cores to use simultaneously).
    \code{spmleCombo} produces estimates that, on average, have significantly
    smaller mean squared error than \code{spmle}, at the cost of increased
    computation to calculate the bootstrap standard error.}
  \item{\code{\link{simulateCC}}}{simulates case-control data with a wide range
    of possible genetic and environmental variables.}
  \item{methods for class \code{"spmle"}}{both \code{spmleCombo} and \code{spmle}
    return objects of class \code{"spmle"}.  A range of S3 methods are provided:
    \code{anova.spmle}, \code{confint.spmle}, \code{logLik.spmle},
    \code{model.matrix.spmle}, \code{plot.spmle}, \code{\link{predict.spmle}},
    \code{print.spmle}, \code{print.summary.spmle}, \code{summary.spmle}, \code{vcov.spmle}}.
