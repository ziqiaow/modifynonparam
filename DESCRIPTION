Description: Implements the methods of Stalder et. al. (https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asx045) and
    Wang et. al. (forthcoming).  These are retrospective estimators that assume Gene-Environment
    independance in the source population, but place no assumptions on the marginal distributions
    of genetic or environmental variables.  G and E can be multivariate, and both continuous
    and discrete variables may be used.
